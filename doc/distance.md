Here‚Äôs a polished, one-liner suitable for a methods section in a top-tier venue:

> We model user spatial utility following classical spatial interaction and discrete choice theory, where distance enters as a disutility term yielding an exponential decay in selection probability (Wilson, 1971; Huff, 1963; de Vries et al., 2004).

## üìä Comparison Table

| Utility form          | Formula                                | Intuition                                         | Math properties                                              | Pros                                                                            | Cons                                                                             | Typical use                                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linear penalty**    | ( U = \beta \cdot s - \gamma \cdot d ) | Each km (or min) reduces utility by fixed amount. | Affine in distance; unbounded below; sensitivity constant.   | Simple, interpretable; easy to tune (\beta,\gamma).                             | Can yield negative utilities; ignores diminishing returns of distance tolerance. | Economic cost models; early rec-sys hybrids.            |
| **Exponential decay** | ( U = s \cdot e^{-\alpha d} )          | Utility drops quickly at first, then flattens.    | Monotone decreasing, bounded in ([0,s]); convex in distance. | Captures ‚Äúdistance deterrence‚Äù effect; empirically supported in spatial choice. | Sensitive to (\alpha) choice; may kill far-away options too harshly.             | Spatial interaction, gravity models, geo-aware rec-sys. |
| **Reciprocal decay**  | ( U = \tfrac{s}{1+\alpha d} )          | Smoothly decreasing; distance penalty tapers.     | Monotone decreasing, asymptote at 0; hyperbolic tail.        | Ensures no hard cutoff; robust to scaling.                                      | Long-tail bias: far items never zero, might clutter rankings.                    | Location-aware ranking; fairness exploration.           |

* (s) = preference/aspect score.
* (d) = distance (km or min).
* (\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = trade-off parameters.

## üîë How to position in your paper

* Say that **linear** = simplest cost model.
* **Exponential** = widely adopted in geography and POI recommendation because it matches human ‚Äúdistance deterrence.‚Äù
* **Reciprocal** = alternative smooth decay, often used when you don‚Äôt want to drop far candidates completely (exploration/fairness).

Do you want me to also sketch how you could **normalize these utilities** (so they are comparable across methods in evaluation) ‚Äî e.g. mapping distance into ([0,1]) via min‚Äìmax before plugging into formulas?


###### .....

Yes ‚Äî there *are* several relatively recent works (last 5-10 years) in POI / location-based recommendation (and related spatial interaction) that explicitly model geographic distance (or spatial influence) in their utility, scoring, or embedding. Below is a non-exhaustive list with **author, venue, year, and the form or role of the distance component** (which you can map to your linear / exponential / reciprocal / hybrid taxonomy). Use these as ‚Äúmodern touchstones‚Äù in your lit review.

## üß† Observations & insights from these modern works

1. **Exponential decay is still common**
   The Yang et al. (2020) work uses ( e^{-\beta \Delta D} ). That remains one of the go-to forms in modern systems. ([ijcai.org][2])

2. **Hybrid / weighted scoring is very popular**
   Many advanced systems don‚Äôt adopt a pure formula (linear / exp / reciprocal) but **mix distance with other factors** (transition likelihood, graph weights, category similarity, social influence). Li et al. (2025) is an example. ([arXiv][5])

3. **Embedding techniques blur explicit distance formulas**
   With hyperbolic or latent metric embedding, distance influence is encoded implicitly in the learned geometry (e.g. Feng et al. for HME). ([li-jing.com][3])

4. **Disentangling user preference vs geographical signal**
   Newer works aim to separate ‚Äúhow much a user likes a place‚Äù vs ‚Äúhow far it is,‚Äù so the distance term is more transparent and tunable. (E.g. 2025 ACM work) ([ACM Digital Library][6])

5. **Attention / GNNs over spatial graphs**
   Using graph neural networks and attention over spatial graphs allows distance (or locality) to dynamically influence edge weights, rather than hard-coded formulas. (STP-UDGAT is one such candidate) ([arXiv][8])

6. **Bias-aware modeling**
   Some works explicitly analyze the bias introduced by distance (i.e. recommendations unduly favor nearby items) and propose mitigation. (S√°nchez et al., 2023) ([SpringerLink][10])

###### .....


Great catch üëÄ ‚Äî you‚Äôre right to notice: **recent work almost always defaults to exponential decay or learned embeddings**, and you don‚Äôt see many modern POI/rec-sys papers explicitly writing down a *reciprocal (1/(1+Œ±d))* distance term anymore.

### Why?

* **Historical origin**: reciprocal decay was common in early **gravity models** (and a few early LBSN / check-in recommenders up to ~2013).
* **Exponential won out**: empirical studies (esp. in geography & mobility mining) show exponential fits human mobility/deterrence better than reciprocal.
* **Deep models obscure it**: newer POI recommenders (graph attention, latent embeddings) often **learn their own decay**, so authors don‚Äôt hardcode reciprocal.
* **Bias concerns**: reciprocal keeps long-tail items ‚Äúalive‚Äù too strongly, which can exaggerate far-away recommendations, conflicting with observed human behavior (most users won‚Äôt travel far).

### Where reciprocal still appears

1. **Early location-based social network (LBSN) recsys**

   * Ye, M., Yin, P., Lee, W.-C. (2011). *Location Recommendation for Location-Based Social Networks.* ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS.
     ‚Üí Uses inverse distance weighting.
2. **Trajectory / check-in smoothing** (2014‚Äì2017)

   * Some mobility prediction papers use inverse distance in kernel functions.
3. **Niche recent uses**

   * In *spatial statistics* or *urban informatics* (not mainstream recsys). Example:

     * Gao, S., Janowicz, K., Couclelis, H. (2017). ‚ÄúExtracting Urban Functional Regions from Points of Interest and Human Activities on Location-Based Social Networks.‚Äù *Transactions in GIS.*
       ‚Üí Reciprocal / power-law type weights used in clustering, not in recommendation.

---

### TL;DR

üëâ **No, there are basically no flagship recsys/POI papers (2020‚Äì2025) that still explicitly use reciprocal distance decay**.

* Modern works overwhelmingly use **exponential** (e.g., Yang et al. IJCAI 2020, lots of SIGIR/KDD 2021‚Äì2024 POI models).
* Reciprocal survives only in older LBSN recsys (2011‚Äì2014) and some **spatial analysis / clustering** outside recsys.

---

Would you like me to **trace a lineage**:

* show how reciprocal was used in 2011‚Äì2014 works,
* then cite papers that explicitly *rejected reciprocal in favor of exponential* in later comparisons (e.g., ‚Äúdistance decay function choice‚Äù studies)?

That way you can write in your paper: *‚Äúreciprocal was explored early, but exponential emerged as the de facto standard due to better empirical fit.‚Äù*
